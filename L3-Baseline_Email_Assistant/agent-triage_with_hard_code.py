Hi John,

I was reviewing the API documentation for the new authentication service and noticed a few endpoints seem to be missing from the specs. Could you help clarify if this was intentional or if we should update the docs?

Specifically, I'm looking at:
- /auth/refresh
- /auth/validate

Thanks!
Alice""",
